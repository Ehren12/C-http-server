# HTTP Server in C üñ•Ô∏è
Very small flask-like HTTP web framework/server for serving static files

### Inspiration üí§
I had just finished the last lecture in the [Harvard's CS50x Course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
and the obvious next step was the final project üò± This was the moment I've been waiting for! I wanted to build something that was technical enough so I could showcase all the skillsets I acquired throughout the course üõ£Ô∏è I also wanted a project that would help me learn more concepts and technologies. At first, I wanted to build a web app with Sveltekit (Javascript framework) and Firebase (Backend as a Service) üî•However, I was already familiar with these technologies and it wouldn't have taken me out of my comfort zone, so I decided to build something with C.

### About my C web-server
If you actually took the time to read my `inspiration`, thanks üíñ
However, It's time to talk about the actual project!
 This project was aimed at building a basic implementation of an HTTP server and possibly evolving to be C's version of the Flask framework in Python (at least that's the end goal) üõ£Ô∏è
 
 The idea is simple...
 Build an HTTP server that can serve static files üóÉÔ∏è
 
This involved building sockets, working with child processes, some string manipulation, and Binary Search Trees (for routing) üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
If you want to play around with the project first clone the repository and make sure you have GCC installed on your machine.

Clone repo

    https://github.com/Ehren12/C-http-server.git
 After cloning the repo you can very simply run üê•
 

    make

After running the above you can now use the server by running

    ./server PORT
Replace PORT with your desired port üîÅ
> üî¥It is required you are on Linux or at least running WSL2 on Windows. If you're on Mac, it may work, not entirely sure...


‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è Be sure to put all the static files you want to serve in the view folder

The project is open for any contributions and It will mean a lot to me if you decide to contribute or even open an issue ‚úçÔ∏è

HAPPY HACKING ‚ú®
